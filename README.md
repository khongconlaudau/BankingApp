### Running Problem
-I have a problem to run for clone when trying to run this project. The dependency javafx does not automatically work so please adding this VM option manually.

add VM options: --module-path /YOURPATH/TO/JAVAFX-SDK/LIB --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

- I also try to encrypt the application.properties but the .gitignore does not work. I will fix it soon.



## Prerequisites
- JDK 21 or higher
- Maven
- Intellij Ultimate Version is used for this project.
